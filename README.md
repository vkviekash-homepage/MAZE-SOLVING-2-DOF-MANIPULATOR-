# MAZE-SOLVING-2-DOF-MANIPULATOR-

Solving Simple mazes using contour detection and image processing and sending the coordinates to Arduino via serial communication to control a 2 DOF manipulator and trace the maze in real-time.

Fabricated a 2 DoF Manipulator. Path planning of the maze, captured by IP camera using python OpenCV by doing contour detection and image processing operations. Using inverse kinematics, the path is traced by the manipulator on a real-time maze
